# Decisions

Choices the owner has made, newest first, with the date each was made. Later work follows them without asking again. Bigger design choices have their own notes in `docs/adr`, and plans live in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

- **2026-11-07 · Copyright.** `LICENSE` reads "Copyright (c) 2026 EXTANT APE". In prose the org is written EXTANT APE; GitHub URLs keep `ExtantApe`. The leak check allows that exact line through `scripts/leak-allow.txt`.
- **2026-11-07 · Name every way data leaves the Mac.** The manifesto lists each one: Claude Code, connectors you turn on, Apple's own sync, and a wall display if you connect one. Anything new that sends data off the Mac is named there first.
- **2026-11-07 · iPhone plans** (not started; details in `docs/ROADMAP.md`). The encrypted backup uses a recovery key you keep, and Theseus suggests saving it in Apple's Passwords. First run suggests iCloud backup, and staying offline is a choice. The backup covers `config.json`, `profile.md` and `data/`. The lockdown button hides and locks, replaces what the Today and Master List notes show, and warns when FileVault is off.
- **2026-11-06 · The wall display is a Pi your Mac sends to.** See `docs/adr/0008-wall-display-sends-to-a-pi.md`.
- **2026-11-04 · Theseus and Ariadne stay separate apps.** Merging them (Shannon) is an idea on the roadmap only.
